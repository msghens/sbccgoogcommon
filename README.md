##Common Libraries for SBCC Google Python Scripts


A set of libraries that seem to be common in all my google api python scripts. This repository is my home to not have to maintain common scripts and classes in multiple projects

Common libraries will include:

- Connect to Oracle
- Google API Domain Calls
  - Get Service connection
  - Name Changes
  - Group connection
- Common secrets file
